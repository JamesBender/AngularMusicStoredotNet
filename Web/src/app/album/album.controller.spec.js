The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of their respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before landing Hurley and recording their debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003), which became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring, as well as some moderate commercial success.","PictureUrl":"http://192.168.100.137/AngularMusicStore.Api/Content/Images/Artist/FalloutBoy.jpg","RelatedArtists":[]},"Tracks":[{"$id":"80","Id":"73a15590-c5cd-47bc-8248-a4f000abd919","Parent":{"$ref":"78"},"AlbumOrder":3,"Length":"00:03:23","Name":"Alone Together","Rating":0},{"$id":"81","Id":"d32ed5b6-4ecd-4711-8865-a4f000abd919","Parent":{"$ref":"78"},"AlbumOrder":11,"Length":"00:04:41","Name":"Save Rock and Rolls","Rating":0},{"$id":"82","Id":"ca19ecd6-026f-4a02-89f1-a4f000abd919","Parent":{"$ref":"78"},"AlbumOrder":1,"Length":"00:04:04","Name":"The Phoenix","Rating":0},{"$id":"83","Id":"deea6898-4d93-4388-95dd-a4f000abd919","Parent":{"$ref":"78"},"AlbumOrder":8,"Length":"00:03:46","Name":"Death Valley","Rating":0},{"$id":"84","Id":"ceaa1b0a-6963-4410-9d36-a4f000abd919","Parent":{"$ref":"78"},"AlbumOrder":7,"Length":"00:03:30","Name":"Miss Missing You","Rating":0},{"$id":"85","Id":"f4067263-3cbc-47b0-a270-a4f000abd919","Parent":{"$ref":"78"},"AlbumOrder":5,"Length":"00:04:04","Name":"Just One Yesterday","Rating":0},{"$id":"86","Id":"2de79acc-3a0b-41b7-a4b8-a4f000abd919","Parent":{"$ref":"78"},"AlbumOrder":4,"Length":"00:04:03","Name":"Where Did the Party Go","Rating":0},{"$id":"87","Id":"70a9b806-8a88-44c3-a67a-a4f000abd919","Parent":{"$ref":"78"},"AlbumOrder":9,"Length":"00:03:24","Name":"Young Volcanos","Rating":0},{"$id":"88","Id":"a7303ebf-dac9-4796-abeb-a4f000abd919","Parent":{"$ref":"78"},"AlbumOrder":2,"Length":"00:03:09","Name":"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light &apos;em Up)","Rating":0},{"$id":"89","Id":"039be75d-c81c-4261-adf6-a4f000abd919","Parent":{"$ref":"78"},"AlbumOrder":6,"Length":"00:03:32","Name":"The Mighty Fall","Rating":0},{"$id":"90","Id":"e482de1d-7433-4519-b7b2-a4f000abd919","Parent":{"$ref":"78"},"AlbumOrder":10,"Length":"00:04:02","Name":"Rat a Tat","Rating":0}]},{"$id":"91","Id":"21d97730-c026-4928-afdd-a4f000abd91b","Name":"Beyonce","ReleaseDate":"2015-08-03T00:00:00","CoverUri":"http://192.168.100.137/AngularMusicStore.Api/Content/Images/Album/Beyonce_Beyonce.png","Parent":{"$id":"92","Id":"8d4ee4b3-d996-4c26-92ea-a4f000abd91b","Name":"Beyonce","Albums":[{"$ref":"91"}],"Bio":"Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (born September 4, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress.
